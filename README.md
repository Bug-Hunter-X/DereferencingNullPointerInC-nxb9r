This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to write to a memory location that hasn't been allocated. The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides a corrected version.  Always check for null pointers before dereferencing to avoid unexpected crashes.
